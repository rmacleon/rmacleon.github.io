## This website is intended to create a landing page for your visitors

**What this website template is able to do:**
- It will provide a "landing" webpage and provide links to your payment service, social media and email accounts.
- It will provide a webpage where you can describe your products and/or services. 
- It is an easy, low cost way to create a web presence for your organization or small business.

If you encounter any website coding issues, please reach out to me at fmacleon@yahoo.com 
If I can identify and fix the problem, I will update and let you know. 

# What will you need to create your own website:
1. **Basic information about your organization/company for the banner section.**
- In a few words, what does your organization/company do?:
- Optional - Social media and other account names, such as, *venmo, paypalme, facebook, x-twitter, linkenin, instagram, pinterest, etsy, youtube*
2. **Photos and what do you want to say:**
- A profile photo in **jpg** format. A headshot photo works best. Name the photo **profile.jpg** (all lowercase). Some windows systems hide file name extensions. Make sure there is only one ".jpg" extension on the file name as shown above and below. 
- Three photos showing your products or services with descriptions. Name the photos **photo1.jpg** **photo2.jpg** **photo3.jpg** (all lowercase)
- Any thing else you want to say about your products or services. There is plenty of space in this section to say as much as you would like so be impactful.
