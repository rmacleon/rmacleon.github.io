# Rebecca MacLeon - Supply Chain Professonal and Creative
### Hey there! I'm Becky
## I am a Supply Chain Professional and the creator of Sometimes Coco, my handcraft business.

**I've always been both analytical and creative**
- I love creating solutions for my business clients using data and delivering the insights in easy-to-follow one-page summaries.  I provide insights into P&Ls, forecasting, and product reviews. 
- It has always married together nicely my technical skills, business knowledge, and people-centered approach. 
- At the same time, I have always created objects by hand- painting, crocheting, knitting, and multi-media crafting. 
- I am both analytical and creative- and Sometimes Coco. 

Sometimes Coco is named after my dog- kinda. My dog, like many dogs, has many names and many eras. Sometimes she looks big, sometimes she looks small. Sometimes she's a formal "Chloe" sometimes a playful "Cocobeans". 
When it came to naming the business, "Sometimes Coco" captures the full range of products offered and the ever-expanding creative pulls. 

# What will you need to create your own website:
1. **Basic information about your organization/company for the banner section.**
- In a few words, what does your organization/company do?:
- Optional - Social media and other account names, such as, *venmo, paypalme, facebook, x-twitter, linkenin, instagram, pinterest, etsy, youtube*
2. **Photos and what do you want to say:**
- A profile photo in **jpg** format. A headshot photo works best. Name the photo **profile.jpg** (all lowercase). Some windows systems hide file name extensions. Make sure there is only one ".jpg" extension on the file name as shown above and below. 
- Three photos showing your products or services with descriptions. Name the photos **photo1.jpg** **photo2.jpg** **photo3.jpg** (all lowercase)
- Any thing else you want to say about your products or services. There is plenty of space in this section to say as much as you would like so be impactful.
